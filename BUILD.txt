To build NEOCDPSP :

* you'll need PSPSDK (I've used svn 690 for neocdpsp 0.5).
* unzipped the source archive in a folder, for example E:\PSP\NEOCDPSPSRC
* open your Cygwin bash
* go in the previously created folder : cd /cygdrive/e/psp/neocdpspsrc
* make

* "make clean" to clean the obj.

* warning : building in "-O4" seems to break something in zlib
* warning : "c68kexec.c" can take a long time to compile

* I've written a small "deploy.sh" based on stuff seen on ps2dev forums
It's a KXPloit script which will send the EBOOT.PSP in the specified folder
The PSP drive letter is hardcoded on first line of script (change it to your one).
Usage : in NEOCDPSPSRC folder after a "make" 
./deploy.sh <folder>, for ex. : ./deploy.sh neocdpsp
it will send it in /PSP/GAME/NEOCDPSP & /PSP/GAME/NEOCDPSP~ (KXPloit)


Happy coding!
